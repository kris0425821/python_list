Pure bliss (and a healthier me!) *\n> \n> The image above perfectly captures my current meal prep victory *  Two gorgeous glass containers hold my perfectly portioned lunches for the week *  Each one is a delightful mix of fluffy white rice, tender pieces of teriyaki chicken, vibrant orange and red bell peppers, and a generous helping of steamed broccoli * It's colorful, it's healthy, and most importantly, it's ready to go!\n> \n> My journey hasn't been without its bumps * My first attempts were * * * well, let's just say less visually appealing *  I overcooked the chicken once, undercooked the veggies another *  I experimented with different containers, finding these glass ones were perfect for microwave heating and easy clean-up *  But with each attempt, I learned *  I learned the optimal cooking times, the best ways to chop my veggies, and how to portion everything evenly *\n> \n> Now, Sunday afternoons are dedicated to my meal prep ritual *  It’s a relaxing way to spend an hour or two, knowing that I've saved myself time and stress during the busy week ahead *  No more frantic searches for something healthy and quick – just delicious, nutritious meals ready to be enjoyed *  It's a small change with a big impact on my overall health and well-being *  Give it a try! You might surprise yourself at how easy and rewarding it can be *\n"
